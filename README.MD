Apothecary is a mostly archaic term for a medical professional who formulates and dispenses ~~medicine~~ links to ~~physicians, surgeons and patients~~ anyone refined enough to read this.

As you’re browsing through my curated links, you might decide you want to visit similar resources. I’m still deciding on how this will play out but the general idea will remain the same. I thought attempting to classify them in some manner would make things far more accessible than my approach so far.

This is now a staging area for the links as I parse through them, currently the links are split out across various markdown files. Soon this will point to all of them but that comes in the future.
